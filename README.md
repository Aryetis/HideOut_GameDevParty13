SYNOPSIS : 
HideOut is a [2/3/4] Players game, developped during the GDPJam#13 in two days.
Players control your typical slasher movies protagonists. It's the usual situation, dark night, power outage, yadi yada, the problem being that the characters are already familiar with the slasher movie genre, so they know that in the end they can only be one survivor. Therefore players have to avoid the ennemy/Json while also avoiding their "friends" who are kindly trying to knock them out so they can be more easily killed.

HOW TO PLAY :
The goal is simple, be the last avoid, just avoid at all cost Json because they will kill you and be wary about your friends. Keeps in mind that Json can hear the sound of doors opening (represented visually by blue waves), but on the other hand you can hear his footsteps (represented visually by red waves). 

CONTROLS :
Left Stick -> Move the player
A -> Open door
X -> Kick other players
